# WeLoveMovies

Project description: WeLoveMovies
You've been hired on as a backend developer at a new startup called WeLoveMovies! 
As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked
with setting up a database and building out specific routes so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews.

This project allowed me to test my ability to build complex servers and access data through a database.
